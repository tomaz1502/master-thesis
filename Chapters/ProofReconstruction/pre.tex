In this chapter we give a detailed presentation of the Lean scripts originally produced by cvc5, the first approach we tried to employ to lift these scripts into proofs, the reasons that lead us to change it, and the second approach we used. The code for the first approach can be found at\footnote{\url{https://github.com/tomaz1502/signatures/tree/smallCheckers/Cdclt/Lift}}, and the code for the second approach can be found at\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ufmg-smite/lean-smt/tree/main/Smt/Reconstruction/Certifying}}.
