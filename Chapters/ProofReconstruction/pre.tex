In this chapter we show how to lift proofs produced by cvc5 into
proofs of Lean statements using the certified transformations approach.
First, in Section~\ref{sec:gen-scripts}, we present the format used by
cvc5 to print its proofs as Lean scripts.
Then, in Section~\ref{sec:certified_rcons}, we outline the necessary
steps to lift these scripts into a sequence of certified transformations,
which will have its validity checked by Lean's kernel\footnote{Our implementation of this lifting can be found at \url{https://github.com/tomaz1502/lean-smt/tree/main/Smt/Reconstruction/Certified}}.
Lastly, in Section~\ref{sec:downsides}, we present some downsides of this approach.
