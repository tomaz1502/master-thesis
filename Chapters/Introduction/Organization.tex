In Chapter~\ref{chap:formalPrelim} we present the concepts involved in our work.
We describe the SMT problem in detail, as well as the main techniques used to solve
it and the proof certificates produced by cvc5. We also present Lean and give
an overview of the features of the language we have employed throughout the project.
%
Then, in Chapter~\ref{chap:certified}, we describe the steps necessary to implement
the reconstruction of proofs from cvc5 in Lean using the approach of certified
transformations.
%
Next, in Chapter~\ref{chap:rcons}, we present in detail our implementation of the
reconstruction using the certifying transformations approach.
%
This implementation is evaluated in Chapter~\ref{chap:eval}.
%
Finally, we present some possible directions for future work in
Chapter~\ref{chap:future}.
