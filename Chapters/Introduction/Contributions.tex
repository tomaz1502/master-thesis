Given this context, our goal is to implement a tool that would be an essential
part of the integration between the ITP Lean 4~\cite{lean} and the
satisfiability modulo theories (SMT)~\cite{Barrett2018}
solver cvc5~\cite{cvc5}.
%
Our motivation to use an SMT solver as the automatic prover in this effort is
their success as widely used backbones of formal methods tools in a variety of
applications, besides having been central in previous integrations with
ITPs~\cite{sledgehammer, smtcoq}.
%
Specifically, we aim to build a system that takes proofs of the unsatisfiability of
SMT queries produced by cvc5 and reconstructs and checks them using Lean.
%
The main motivation of this project is that despite the fact that Lean is
emerging as a promising programming language and proof assistant and being
widely used by mathematicians in large-scale
formalizations~\cite{mathlib, scholze}, there is currently no way to
interact with SMT solvers from it. The contribution of the present work
would enable a faster development of this kind of project using Lean.

We use the cvc5 solver because it already has a module for exporting proofs as
Lean scripts~\cite{Barbosa2022}, using a representation of the SMT terms~\footnote{For more details
about the SMT term language, see SMT-LIB~\cite{smtlib}.} as an inductive type in
the proof assistant.
