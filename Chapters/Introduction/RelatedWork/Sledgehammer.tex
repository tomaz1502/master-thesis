The ITP Isabelle/HOL~\cite{Nipkow2002} has a similar tool,
namely, Sledgehammer~\cite{sledgehammer}. This system achieves its goal by
invoking several SMT solvers in parallel to prove a given goal and collecting
their output to determine which lemmas must be applied in order to prove the theorem
inside Isabelle. In a way, this approach is very similar to the one we're using in this project, as the proof is produced on
the fly (known as the Certifying approach, which will also be described in Section~\ref{sec:certifiedVsCertifying}) as opposed
to having a single theorem that establishes once and for all
that, if all steps performed by the solver were successful,
then the original goal is valid, as is done by SMTCoq.
