One notable example of hammer is SMTCoq~\cite{smtcoq}.
It is a plugin for the proof assistant Coq~\cite{Bertot2004} that
can be used as a tactic to prove theorems via their encoding into
SMT and by lifting proofs produced by the SMT solvers veriT~\cite{Bouton2009}
and CVC4~\cite{Barrett2011}. The tool can support multiple solvers
due to a preprocessor written in OCaml, that is able to turn the different
proof formats they emmit into an unified certificate in the Coq language,
that will be used as input for the plugin. Our tool explores one specific
format of cvc5, therefore, for now, it only supports this solver and is
less flexible in this aspect then SMTCoq.

The Coq hammer follows directly the Certified transformations approach, described in
the previous section. It has a set of certified functions representing the transformations
that can be done in the theory of Equality and Uninterpreted Functions and
Linear Integer Arithmetic, as well as resolution chains. The way that SMT solvers prove
that a proposition is true is by showing that it's negation is unsatisfiable
\tom{it's okay to use unsatisfiable without defining it first?}. This kind of proof
is parsed in SMTCoq into a sequence of applications of certified functions, which have
to transform the negation of the original goal into a
term that will be lifted to the \textit{False} proposition in Coq. Once the
ITP verifies that the sequence of steps produced by the solver indeed
produces \textit{False}, the original theorem can be automatically closed,
as we described in the previous section.

SMTCoq also differs from our work as it implements a translation module, but
it does not implement a premiss selection module.
