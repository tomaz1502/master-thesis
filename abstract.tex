Despite their expressivity and robustness, interactive theorem pro\-vers (ITPs)
can be quite costly to use in large-scale formalizations due to the burden of
interactively proving goals.
%
Discharging some of these goals via automatic theorem provers, such as
satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers, is a known way of improving the
usability of ITPs.
%
This paper describes the early stages of a novel integration between the ITP
Lean 4 and the SMT solver cvc5.
%
Assuming an encoding of the Lean goal as an SMT problem and that cvc5
generates a proof for the encoded problem, we show how to lift this proof into
a proof of the original Lean goal.
%
This requires proving the correctness, inside Lean, of the steps taken by the
solver, as well as decoding the terms in the proof into the original Lean
ones. Thus Lean can accept the SMT proof as a proof of the original goal.
%
Once complete, this tool can be used to implement a tactic in Lean that
automatically discharges goals via cvc5.
