Despite their expressivity and robustness, interactive theorem provers (ITPs)
can be prohibitively costly to use in large-scale formalizations due to the burden of
interactively proving goals.
%
Discharging some of these goals via automatic theorem provers, such as
satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers, is a known way of improving the
usability of ITPs.
%
This thesis describes a novel integration between the ITP
Lean 4 and the SMT solver cvc5.

Given the encoding of some Lean goal as an SMT problem and a proof from
cvc5 of the encoded problem, we show how to lift this proof into a proof
of the original goal.
%
This requires proving the correctness, inside Lean, of the steps taken by the
solver. This will allow Lean's proof checker to accept the SMT proof as a
proof of the original goal.

This set of techniques is part of the joint project Lean-SMT, which aims to create a
tactic in Lean that can soundly invoke an external SMT solver by translating a Lean
goal into an SMT query; proving the goal using a proof-producing SMT solver; and,
when successful, lifting the SMT proof to close the original Lean goal
(which is done by the techniques presented here).
